In the field of medicine, doctors and medical students must keep up with a vast amount of lecture notes, encyclopedias, and academic papers. This information is essential for diag- nosing and treating patients, especially in critical situations. However, finding and understanding this knowledge can be very time-consuming and challenging.

To address this issue, a new chatbot model has been developed to assist doctors and medical students in quickly accessing medical literature and information. Unlike general AI models such as OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, this chatbot is specif- ically trained on medical data and uses language that is easy to understand.

The creation of this model involved several important steps. First, a special dataset was compiled from numerous PDF documents covering various medical topics. These documents were then converted into a question-and-answer format using a custom data generation module. This process made the in- formation more accessible and allowed the chatbot to provide clear and concise answers to medical questions.

Next, a pre-trained language model was fine-tuned with this new dataset. This additional training helped the model understand medical terms and concepts more deeply, making it a valuable resource for medical professionals and students. To ensure the model remains current and comprehensive, a web scraping module was added. This module allows the model to access the latest information from reliable medical websites, providing knowledge that the model may lack. This real-time updating process ensures that any gaps in the modelâ€™s knowledge are quickly filled, enhancing its accuracy and usefulness.

Additionally, a dedicated website was created to provide easy access to the chatbot. This website allows doctors and medical students to interact with the model effortlessly, ob- taining the information they need quickly and efficiently. The aim of this project is to revolutionize the way medical professionals and students access medical information. By providing a faster and more accurate method of acquiring knowledge, the chatbot significantly improves the efficiency of medical practice and education. With this tool, doctors and medical students will be able to solve medical cases more effectively and enhance their expertise.
